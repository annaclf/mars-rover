In this game you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard, or call the moveRover() function in the console, to move the green arrow forward, right, left or backwards to reach the pink box. 

The moveRover() function takes a single string as argument to follow directions. Valid chars are l,r,f,b. Eg moveRover('ffllffbr');
